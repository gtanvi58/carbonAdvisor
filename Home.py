st.markdown("## A Tool for Assessing and Minimizing the Carbon Emissions of ML Tasks")

st.markdown("A Carbon Footprint Analyzer for ML Tasks is a tool or software designed to measure the environmental impact of \
            machine learning workflows. It helps data scientists, ML engineers, and other stakeholders to analyze and reduce the carbon \
            footprint of their AI models and applications. The tool provides a comprehensive report of the carbon emissions associated with \
            each ML task or workflow, including data processing, training, and inference. It can also suggest optimizations and alternative approaches\
             to minimize the carbon footprint of the ML workload. The goal of a Carbon Footprint Analyzer for ML Tasks is to promote sustainable \
            and responsible AI development, by enabling practitioners to make informed decisions about the environmental impact of their work and \
            take steps towards reducing it.")
