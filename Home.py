    "Carbon Advisor is a software simulation for batch processing tasks. Carbon Advior analyze the impact of different descisions and thier enviromental impact. \
            Carbon Advisor helps data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders to analyze and reduce the carbon footprint of their applications. \
            The tool provides a comprehensive report of the carbon emissions associated with each task across location. It can also suggest optimizations and alternative approaches\
             to minimize the carbon footprint of tasks. The goal of Carbon Advisor is to promote sustainable \
            and responsible computing, by enabling practitioners to make informed decisions about the environmental impact of their work and \
            take steps towards reducing it."
